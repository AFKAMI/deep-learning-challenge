# deep-learning-challenge

# Background
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

# Instructions
# Step 1: Preprocess the Data
Using your knowledge of Pandas and scikit-learn’s StandardScaler(), you’ll need to preprocess the dataset. This step prepares you for Step 2, where you'll compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

Start by uploading the starter file to Google Colab, then using the information we provided in the Challenge files, follow the instructions to complete the preprocessing steps.

1. Read in the charity_data.csv to a Pandas DataFrame, and be sure to identify the following in your dataset:
What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the feature(s) for your model?
2. Drop the EIN column.

3. Determine the number of unique values for each column.

4. For columns that have more than 10 unique values, determine the number of data points for each unique value.

5. Use the number of data points for each unique value to pick a cutoff point to bin "rare" categorical variables together in a new value, Other, and then check if the binning was successful.

6. Use pd.get_dummies() to encode categorical variables.

7. Split the preprocessed data into a features array, X, and a target array, y. Use these arrays and the train_test_split function to split the data into training and testing datasets.

8. Scale the training and testing features datasets by creating a StandardScaler instance, fitting it to the training data, then using the transform function.

# Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, you’ll design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. You’ll need to think about how many inputs there are before determining the number of neurons and layers in your model. Once you’ve completed that step, you’ll compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.

1. Continue using the file in Google Colab in which you performed the preprocessing steps from Step 1.

2. Create a neural network model by assigning the number of input features and nodes for each layer using TensorFlow and Keras.

3. Create the first hidden layer and choose an appropriate activation function.

4. If necessary, add a second hidden layer with an appropriate activation function.

5. Create an output layer with an appropriate activation function.

6. Check the structure of the model.

7. Compile and train the model.

8. Create a callback that saves the model's weights every five epochs.

9. Evaluate the model using the test data to determine the loss and accuracy.

10. Save and export your results to an HDF5 file. Name the file AlphabetSoupCharity.h5.

# Step 3: Optimize the Model
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, optimize the model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.

Use the following methods to optimize my model:

1. Adjust the input data to ensure that no variables or outliers are causing confusion in the model, such as:
adding NAME column.
2. Creating more bins for NAME columns .
3. Increasing or decreasing the number of values for each bin.
4. Add third neurons to a hidden layer.
5. Add more hidden layers.

# Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

* Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
* The target variable is the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column from application_df.
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
* The feature variables are every other column from application_df.
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
* first model I droped EIN and NAME columns and verall the accuracy was at 73% and the second try added the NAME column and give higher accuracy of 75%
  
* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* first model I started with 2 hidden layer and the second times I added another layer which increase my accuracy from 73% to 75%.
  
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* yes with several models and adding more columns and bins. 

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
* with adding more columns, more hidden layers, more bins we were able to increase the accuracy of the model. 

# Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.

Overall, the deep learning model was around 75% accuracy rate in predicting the classification problem and funding success rate. By cleaning the data and finding more outliers will cause the higher accuracy.
